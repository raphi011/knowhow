## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 31 of 31 v1 requirements

**Adjusted:** None

**Dropped:** None

**Notes:**
- TEST-01 completed with 29/31 tests passing, 2 skipped due to Go SDK v1.2.0 CBOR incompatibility with SurrealDB v3 graph range syntax
- GRPH-01/GRPH-02 implementation complete but runtime execution may fail due to SDK limitation
